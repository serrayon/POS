Steps to Implement:

Dataset Preparation:

Dataset: Use annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank, which provides sentences with POS tags (noun, verb, etc.).
Format: Each sentence in the dataset should be paired with its corresponding POS tags.
Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization: Break sentences into individual words or tokens.
Feature Extraction: Extract features (like word suffixes, prefixes, context words) to train the POS tagging model.
Model Selection and Training:

Model: Start with a simple approach like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs), which are effective for POS tagging.
Training: Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
Evaluation:

Metrics: Use accuracy and F1-score to evaluate the performance of your POS tagging model.
Adjustments: Fine-tune the model parameters or consider more advanced techniques (like deep learning models if desired) to improve performance.
Integration and Testing:

Integration: Once the model performs well on test data, integrate it into a functional system where users can input sentences and receive POS-tagged output.
Testing: Test the system with various sentences to ensure accurate POS tagging across different contexts.
